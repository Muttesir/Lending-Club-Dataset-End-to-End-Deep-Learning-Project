# Lending-Club-Dataset-End-to-End-Deep-Learning-Project

The Data
Subset of the LendingClub DataSet obtained from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wordsforthewise/lending-club

What is Kaggle?

Kaggle allows users to find and publish data sets, explore and build models in a web-based data-science environment, work with other data scientists and machine learning engineers, and enter competitions to solve data science challenges.

My Aims

To solve credit fraud detection using deep learning models; in the future, when the companies get a new potential client, they will be able to anticipate whether or not they will repay the loan. Furthermore, this project will assist finance organisations in calculating the risk that their clients will pose, learning ahead of time about a prospective non-repayment issue, and taking action according to the customer.

This project will be Three Sections

Section1: Exploratory Data Analysis, aims of this sections; get an understanding for which variables are important, view summary statistics, and visualize the data.

Section2: Data PreProcessing, aims of this section; remove or fill any missing data. Remove unnecessary or repetitive features. Convert categorical string features to dummy variables.

Section3: Creating and Evaluating Model Performance, aims of this section; Predict whether give loans to new customers , finding customers whether paying back their loan.
